For post methods to describe the format in which we expect data, we make classes from pydantic basemodel
we made different types of models of user also . why?
then without an official db, we simulate a fake/temp db by list, dict
we made post method to send data from user to db and validate it and raise error handling/exceptions
we made a utility fn of id assignment and uto incremented ready for next user
then we made get method to fetch users and return in a response models
returning in a response model is imp for validation

revised some things of python like del and .get() method of dicts.
