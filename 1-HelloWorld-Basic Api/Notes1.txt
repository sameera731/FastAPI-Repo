# 📂 1_hello-world-basic-api

## 🛠 Dependencies
- Python 3.10
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

Installed with:
    pip install fastapi uvicorn

---

## 🚀 Commands to Start Server
1. Go to repo root:
    cd "C:\Self skills\FastAPI Repo"

2. Activate virtual environment:
    venv\Scripts\activate

3. Go into project folder:
    cd 1_hello-world-basic-api

4. Start FastAPI server:
    uvicorn main:app --reload

5. Open in browser:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs  (Swagger UI)
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc (ReDoc UI)

6. Every time you install a new dependency in future folders, update requirements.txt with:

   pip freeze > requirements.txt

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Build a **basic FastAPI app** with:
- A root route (`/`)
- A static route (`/hello`)
- A dynamic route with path & query params (`/items/{item_id}?q=...`)

---

## ✅ Tasks Done
- Installed FastAPI & Uvicorn inside venv
- Created `main.py` with 3 endpoints
- Ran server with `uvicorn`
- Tested endpoints in browser and Swagger docs
- Saw FastAPI auto validation in action

---

## 📘 What I Learned
- How to create and activate a virtual environment  
- How to install FastAPI + Uvicorn  
- How `@app.get()` decorators map HTTP routes  
- FastAPI auto-converts Python dict → JSON  
- Path params (`{item_id}`) vs Query params (`?q=value`)  
- FastAPI auto-validates types (int vs str errors)  
- Swagger docs are auto-generated and interactive  

---

## ✍️ Personal Notes
(Add your own thoughts here, for example:)
- Swagger UI feels like Postman but built-in  
- Path params are strict about type hints  
- Validation errors are very clear and helpful  

---

## ⚠️ Mistakes & Potential Mistakes
- Tried running `python3.10` (Linux-style) → ❌ not working on Windows  
- Forgot to `activate` venv before `uvicorn` → ❌ "module not found"  
- Naming mistake: file must be `main.py` if running `uvicorn main:app`  
- Using wrong Python version (3.13 might break some libs)  

---

## 📌 Do's and Don'ts
### ✅ Do's
- Always activate venv before running server  
- Use type hints (`int`, `str`) → FastAPI validates automatically  
- Check Swagger docs for quick testing  
- Add `venv/` to `.gitignore`  

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don’t create separate venv for each folder (too heavy)  
- Don’t name your file `fastapi.py` (conflicts with package import)  
- Don’t skip reading error messages (they are very descriptive)
